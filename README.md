# PureBrowser
The web browser of PureOS. Based on Iceweasel, but with more consideration to privacy and safety.

PureBrowser takes Debian's Iceweasel and includes a number of the changes made for GNU's IceCat,
along with some extensions that we like - [privacybadger](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox), [ublock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), [https-everywhere](https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere), [html5-video-everywhere](https://github.com/lejenome/html5-video-everywhere), and [decentraleyes](https://github.com/Synzvato/decentraleyes).

DuckDuckGo's search page is the default, as well as the homepage. Other search engines included are
ixquick, startpage, creative commons, wikipedia, and disconnect.me.
