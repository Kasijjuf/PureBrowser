# PureBrowser
The web browser of PureOS. Based on Iceweasel, but with more consideration to privacy and safety.

PureBrowser takes Debian's Iceweasel and includes a number of the changes made for GNU's IceCat,
along with some extensions that we like - privacybadger, https-everywhere, and html5-video-everywhere.

DuckDuckGo's search page is the default, as well as the homepage. Other search engines included are
ixquick, startpage, creative commons, wikipedia, and disconnect.me.
